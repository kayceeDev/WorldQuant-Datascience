# WorldQuant university Data science Training
## Course overview

## Unit-1 Python

> <p>these unit contained a hands-on intro to python for data science. Students was exposed to python framework like pandas, numpy for data wrangling and analysis and also other tools like Structured query language for data gathering and explorations</p>

## Projects: overview

## Program Flow exercises¶
> The objective of these exercises is to develop your ability to use iteration and conditional logic to build reusable functions. We will be extending our get_primes example from the Program Flow notebook for testing whether much larger numbers are prime. Large primes are useful for encryption. It is too slow to test every possible factor of a large number to determine if it is prime, so we will take a different approach.

## Object-oriented exercises: Introduction
>The objective of these exercises is to develop your familiarity with Python's class syntax and object-oriented programming. By deepening our understanding of Python objects, we will be better prepared to work with complex data structures and machine learning models. We will develop a Point class capable of handling some simple linear algebra operations in 2D.

## DW Miniproject: Introduction
> The objective of this miniproject is to exercise your ability to wrangle tabular data set and aggregate large data sets into meaningful summary statistics. We'll work with the same medical data used in the pw miniproject but leverage the power of Pandas to more efficiently represent and act on our data.

## PW Miniproject: Introduction
>The objective of this miniproject is to exercise your ability to use basic Python data structures, define functions, and control program flow. We will be using these concepts to perform some fundamental data wrangling tasks such as joining data sets together, splitting data into groups, and aggregating data into summary statistics. Please do not use pandas or numpy to answer these questions.

>We will be working with medical data from the British NHS on prescription drugs. Since this is real data, it contains many ambiguities that we will need to confront in our analysis. This is commonplace in data science, and is one of the lessons you will learn in this miniproject.


## Unit-2 Machine learning

> <p> With graded assignments and hands-on quizzes, this unit was all about practical machine learning techniques.</p>

## projects : overview
## ML Miniproject: Introduction¶
> The objective of this miniproject is to exercise your ability to create effective machine learning models for making predictions. We will be working with nursing home inspection data from the United States, predicting which providers may be fined and for how much

## NLP Miniproject: Introduction
> The objective of this miniproject is to gain experience with natural language processing and how to use text data to train a machine learning model to make predictions. For the miniproject, we will be working with product review text from Amazon. The reviews are for only products in the "Electronics" category. The objective is to train a model to predict the rating, ranging from 1 to 5 stars.
